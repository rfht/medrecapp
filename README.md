MedRecApp
=========

This is an old project of mine for a browser-based visual medication reconciliation interface that can take a plaintext medication list, make the changes with visual feedback, and create a new medication list that can be returned to the clinical documentation.

The software has bugs in its current state and should primarily be used for illustration of the user interface design principles.
